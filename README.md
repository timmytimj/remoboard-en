Remoboard is an input method application that allows you to use your computer to type on your mobile phone, making mobile typing faster. When using Remoboard, a web address will be displayed on your mobile phone, and you can start typing by visiting this URL in a computer browser. The text entered in the browser is sent to the mobile phone, allowing the computer to type on the mobile phone.

1. Since this software has met the needs of the original design, there are no plans to continue to continue development, at present.

2. Currently, Remoboard is available for iOS and Android and is free to download and use. Thank you for your continued support.

3. Please note that due to the complexity of networking environments, there may be some cases where it is not possible to use the app. The web connection mode is relatively stable, but the functions in the lab are not currently being updated or improved and are not recommended for use.
